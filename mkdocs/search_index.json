The first step to customizing the existing rules and settings is to create a \nbh_core.sublime-settings\n in your \nUser\n folder.  This is where the bracket and style rules and settings live.  By changing these settings, you can add support for new languages, or change the look of highlighting, and much more.\n\n\nCore Settings\n\n\nStyles and colors will be discussed in greater depth in the \nConfiguring Highlight Style\n section.  But there are a number of general setting you can adjust to change how things look or work.  These settings are found in \nbh_core.sublime-settings\n.\n\n\nVisual Settings\n\n\nThese are the settings related to the visual appearance of \nBH\n.\n\n\nshow_in_minimap\n\n\nShows highlighted brackets in the minimap.  This will work with all highlight styles except \nunderline\n; \nthin_underline\n has no issues.\n\n\n    \n// Show brackets in the minimap.\n\n    \nshow_in_minimap\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshow_unmatched\n\n\nDisplays a special highlight for brackets that cannot be matched.\n\n\n    \n// When only either the left or right bracket can be found\n\n    \n// this defines if the unmatched bracket should be shown.\n\n    \nshow_unmatched\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshow_unmatched_exceptions\n\n\nList of languages in which the \nshow_unmatched\n option logic will be reversed.\n\n\n    \n// Do the opposite of \nshow_unmatched\n for the languages listed below\n\n    \nshow_unmatched_exceptions\n:\n \n[],\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontent_highlight_bar\n\n\nAn experimental setting which can enable the display of a vertical bar that extends from the line containing the opening bracket to the line with the closing bracket.  Takes a boolean \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n.  When \nalign_content_highlight_bar\n is set to \nfalse\n, the bar will be shown on the first column regardless of indent level of the brackets.  When \nalign_content_highlight_bar\n is set to \ntrue\n, the bar will be aligned at the bracket indent level.\n\n\n    \n// Experimental: Creates a visible bar at the beginning of all lines between\n\n    \n// multiline bracket spans.\n\n    \ncontent_highlight_bar\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalign_content_highlight_bar\n\n\nModifies the behavior of \ncontent_highlight_bar\n and draws the vertical content bar at the indentation level of the highlighted bracket, but there are some limitations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content bar cannot extend through an empty line unless the bar is on the first column.  This is a limitation of the Sublime API.  Empty lines will have cause a gap in the bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content bar will not be shown on a line where non-whitespace characters cross the bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n// Experimental: Align the content highlight bar at the bracket indent level\n\n    \nalign_content_highlight_bar\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhigh_visibility_enabled_by_default\n\n\nEnables high visibility mode by default.  High visibility mode highlights not only the bracket but the content between as well, but it is disabled by default and must be toggled on to be used.  This reverses the behavior and has it on by default. Takes a boolean \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n.\n\n\n    \n// Enable high visibility by default when sublime starts up\n\n    \nhigh_visibility_enabled_by_default\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhigh_visibility_style\n\n\nModifies the styling of high visibility mode.  The available options are \nsolid\n, \noutline\n, \nunderline\n, \nthin_underline\n, \nsquiggly\n, and \nstippled\n.\n\n\n    \n// High visibility style and color for high visibility mode\n\n    \nhigh_visibility_style\n:\n \noutline\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhigh_visibility_color\n\n\nModifies the high visibility color.  There are three types of settings you can use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__default__\n is a special reserved value which will use the color set in \nbracket_styles\n.  See \nConfiguring Highlight Style\n for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__bracket__\n is a special reserved value which will inherit the defined color of the highlighted bracket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny valid scope found in your color scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n// Color for high visibility mode\n\n    \nhigh_visibility_color\n:\n \n__bracket__\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavioral Settings\n\n\nThese settings affect the matching behavior.\n\n\nmatch_only_adjacent\n\n\nCauses \nBH\n to only match and highlight brackets when the cursor is adjacent to a bracket.\n\n\n    \n// Match brackets only when the cursor is touching the inside of the bracket\n\n    \nmatch_only_adjacent\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbracket_outside_adjacent\n\n\nAugments the matching behavior and will trigger matching when the cursor is adjacent to a cursor on the outside (not between the brackets).\n\n\n    \n// Outside adjacent bracket matching\n\n    \nbracket_outside_adjacent\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblock_cursor_mode (EXPERIMENTAL)\n\n\nModifies the bracket matching mode for block cursor.  The bracket matching mode is one that makes a little more sense to some people in regards to the visual representation of block cursors.  So if you are someone that uses block cursors and find that toggling \nbracket_outside_adjacent\n still doesn\nt quite match brackets how you would like, you can give this setting a try.\n\n\nWhen this setting is enabled, \nbracket_outside_adjacent\n will be ignored.\n\n\n    \n// EXPERIMENTAL: Special matching mode for block cursor.\n\n    \n// Essentially, this provides a matching mode that makes a little more\n\n    \n// sense to some in regards to the visual representation of block cursors.\n\n    \n// This will ignore \nbracket_outside_adjacent\n.\n\n    \nblock_cursor_mode\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nignore_outside_adjacent_in_plugin\n\n\nIgnores the \nbracket_outside_adjacent\n setting when running a plugin \nif\n the plugin sets \nno_outside_adj\n to \nnull\n (\nnull\n for JSON or \nNone\n in Python).\n\n\n    \n// When \nbracket_outside_adjacet\n is set, and a plugin command explicitly sets\n\n    \n// \nno_outside_adj\n \nNone\n instead of \ntrue\n or the default \nfalse\n,\n\n    \n// this value will be used.\n\n    \nignore_outside_adjacent_in_plugin\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nignore_block_mode_in_plugin (EXPERIMENTAL)\n\n\nIgnores the \nblock_cursor_mode\n setting when running a plugin \nif\n the plugin sets \nno_block_mode\n to \nnull\n (\nnull\n for JSON or \nNone\n in Python).\n\n\n    \n// When \nblock_cursor_mode\n is set, and a plugin command explicitly sets\n\n    \n// \nno_block_mode\n to \nNone\n instead of \ntrue\n or the default \nfalse\n,\n\n    \n// this value will be used.\n\n    \nignore_block_mode_in_plugin\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbracket_string_escape_mode\n\n\nDepending on the setting, \nBH\n will either match sub-brackets inside strings with traditional string escape logic, or will match sub-brackets in strings with regex escape logic.  Takes a string value of either \nregex\n or \nstring\n.\n\n\n    \n// Set mode for string escapes to ignore (regex|string)\n\n    \nbracket_string_escape_mode\n:\n \nstring\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsearch_threshold\n\n\nSets the search threshold.  The search threshold determines how many characters \nBH\n will search through to find matching brackets before giving up.  This setting only affects auto-matching and not on-demand calls from the command palette and menu. By default, this value is very conservative and can be increased.  Keep in mind that a very large values may impact performance.\n\n\n    \n// Character threshold to search\n\n    \nsearch_threshold\n:\n \n5000\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nignore_threshold\n\n\nCauses \nsearch_threshold\ns\n limit to be ignored.  It is not advised to use this as very large files may cause a noticeable performance hit, but has been made available due to a number of requests.\n\n\n    \n// Ignore threshold\n\n    \nignore_threshold\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nauto_selection_threshold\n\n\nA numerical value which controls the maximum number of simultaneous auto-matched brackets that are allowed.

When disabled, \nBH\n will just highlight up to the threshold limit.\n\n\n    \n// Enable this to completely kill highlighting if \nauto_selection_threshold\n\n    \n// is exceeded.  Default is to highlight up to the \nauto_selection_threshold\n.\n\n    \nkill_highlight_on_threshold\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nno_multi_select_icons\n\n\nDisables gutter icons when doing multiple selections.\n\n\n    \n// Disable gutter icons when doing multi-select\n\n    \nno_multi_select_icons\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTag Plugin Settings\n\n\nTag settings found in \nbh_tag.sublime-settings\n.\n\n\ntag_style\n\n\nSets the highlight style for the tag plugin.  The string value should correspond to a style entry in \nbracket_styles\n.

There are two kinds of brackets you can define: \nscope_brackets\n which search the file for scope regions and then use regex to test for opening and closing brackets, and \nbrackets\n which use regex to find opening and closing brackets.  \nbrackets\n type rules should usually be the preferred type.  \nscope_brackets\n are usually used for brackets whose opening and closing are the same and are not easily distinguishable from one another by regex; scope brackets must be contained in a continuous scope region like string for quotes etc.\n\n\nBH\n uses a wrapper around Python\ns re regex library to add support for additional back references.  See the \nExtended Regex Guide\n.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nBrackets can be modified, or even added, without copying the entire bracket rule list to the user settings.

This was a cumbersome requirement that also punished a user because if they did this, they wouldn\nt automatically get updates to the rules as all the rules were now overridden by the user\ns settings file.\n\n\nBracketHighlighter now lets you add or modify existing rules without overriding the entire rule set, or even the entire target rule.  Let\ns say you have a custom language you want to have on your machine. Now, you can simply add it to one of the two settings arrays: \nuser_scope_brackets\n and \nuser_brackets\n:\n\n\n    \nuser_scope_brackets\n:\n \n[],\n\n    \nuser_brackets\n:\n \n[\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nname\n:\n \nmylang\n,\n\n            \nopen\n:\n \n^\\\\s*\\\\b(if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro|do)\\\\b\n,\n\n            \nclose\n:\n \n\\\\b(e(?:if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro)|until)\\\\b\n,\n\n            \nstyle\n:\n \ndefault\n,\n\n            \nscope_exclude\n:\n \n[\nstring\n,\n \ncomment\n],\n\n            \nplugin_library\n:\n \nUser.bh_modules.mylangkeywords\n,\n\n            \nlanguage_filter\n:\n \nwhitelist\n,\n\n            \nlanguage_list\n:\n \n[\nmylang\n],\n\n            \nenabled\n:\n \ntrue\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n],\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\ns say you want to modify an existing rule, maybe just tweak the language list, all you have to do is use the same name and the item you want to change.

The name of the style corresponds to a style definition.  Style definitions are defined under \nbracket_styles\n in \nbh_core.sublime-settings\n.\n\n\nThere are two special style definitions whose names are reserved: \ndefault\n and \nunmatched\n, but you can configure them.  All other custom style definitions follow the same pattern.  You can look at \ncurly\n below and compare to the special style definitions; the format is the same.  All custom styles follow this pattern.  See description below:\n\n\n        \n// \ndefault\n style defines attributes that\n\n        \n// will be used for any style that does not\n\n        \n// explicitly define that attribute.  So if\n\n        \n// a style does not define a color, it will\n\n        \n// use the color from the \ndefault\n style.\n\n        \ndefault\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nicon\n:\n \ndot\n,\n\n            \ncolor\n:\n \nbrackethighlighter.default\n,\n\n            \nstyle\n:\n \nunderline\n\n        \n},\n\n\n        \n// This particular style is used to highlight\n\n        \n// unmatched bracket pairs.

For example, lets say you have a bracket that is case sensitive.  \nBH\n uses a case insensitive search, so with validate, you can ensure the originally found bracket matches the desired case.\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\nThe name of the bracket definition being evaluated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbracket\n\n\nThe bracket region being validated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbracket_side\n\n\nOpening (0) or closing (1) bracket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbfr\n\n\nThe file buffer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean\n\n\nindicates whether the validation succeeded (True) or failed (False).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Should match closing tag \nend\n but not match \nEnd\n\n\ncase\n \nFoo\n \nof\n\n    \nGuard1\n \n-\n \nok\n;\n\n    \nGuard2\n \n-\n \nEnd\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample (from erlangcase.py):\n\n\ndef\n \nvalidate\n(\nname\n,\n \nbracket\n,\n \nbracket_side\n,\n \nbfr\n):\n\n    \ntext\n \n=\n \nbfr\n[\nbracket\n.\nbegin\n:\nbracket\n.\nend\n]\n\n    \nreturn\n \ntext\n.\nlower\n()\n \n==\n \ntext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompare\n\n\n\n\ndef compare(name, first, second, bfr)\n\n\n\n\ncompare\n is run when comparing the opening bracket with closing brackets.

When defining a manually invoked \nBH\n command, either \nbh_key\n or \nbh_async_key\n should be used (key referring to key binding, but is also used for the menu and command palette).  It may be misleading as to what \nbh_async_key\n means, but it is mainly a workaround to launch \nBH\n keys from the command palette.  The command is kicked off asynchronously to ensure the palette closes before executing, but the \nBH\n command itself is still synchronous.\n\n\nExample of run instance plugin getting called:\n\n\n// Go to left bracket\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncaption\n:\n \nBracketHighlighter: Jump to Left Bracket\n,\n\n        \ncommand\n:\n \nbh_key\n,\n\n        \nargs\n:\n\n        \n{\n\n            \nlines\n \n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n            \nplugin\n:\n\n            \n{\n\n                \ntype\n:\n \n[\n__all__\n],\n\n                \ncommand\n:\n \nbh_modules.bracketselect\n,\n\n                \nargs\n:\n \n{\nselect\n:\n \nleft\n}\n\n            \n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nargs\n parameter is a dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlines\n\n\nShow the number of lines between the matched brackets in the status bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nno_outside_adj\n\n\nThis is a parameter used to tell the plugin to ignore the \nbracket_outside_adjacent\nsetting.

The default is \nfalse\nwhen not defined, but it can be set to \ntrue\nor \nnull\nin JSON (it would be \nNone\nif defined directly in Python code).

There are two kinds of brackets you can define:  scope_brackets  which search the file for scope regions and then use regex to test for opening and closing brackets, and  brackets  which use regex to find opening and closing brackets.   brackets  type rules should usually be the preferred type.   scope_brackets  are usually used for brackets whose opening and closing are the same and are not easily distinguishable from one another by regex; scope brackets must be contained in a continuous scope region like string for quotes etc.  BH  uses a wrapper around Python s re regex library to add support for additional back references.  See the  Extended Regex Guide .   Tip  Brackets can be modified, or even added, without copying the entire bracket rule list to the user settings.  See  Bracket Rule Management  for more info.

Bracket Rule Management  In the past, BracketHighlighter required a user to copy the entire bracket list to the user  bh_core.sublime-settings  file.  This was a cumbersome requirement that also punished a user because if they did this, they wouldn t automatically get updates to the rules as all the rules were now overridden by the user s settings file.  BracketHighlighter now lets you add or modify existing rules without overriding the entire rule set, or even the entire target rule.  Let s say you have a custom language you want to have on your machine. Now, you can simply add it to one of the two settings arrays:  user_scope_brackets  and  user_brackets :       user_scope_brackets :   [], \n     user_brackets :   [ \n         { \n             name :   mylang , \n             open :   ^\\\\s*\\\\b(if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro|do)\\\\b , \n             close :   \\\\b(e(?:if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro)|until)\\\\b , \n             style :   default , \n             scope_exclude :   [ string ,   comment ], \n             plugin_library :   User.bh_modules.mylangkeywords , \n             language_filter :   whitelist , \n             language_list :   [ mylang ], \n             enabled :   true \n         } \n     ],   Let s say you want to modify an existing rule, maybe just tweak the language list, all you have to do is use the same name and the item you want to change. Only that attribute will be overridden:       user_brackets :   [ \n         // Angle \n         { \n             name :   angle , \n             language_list :   [ \n                 HTML ,   HTML 5 ,   XML ,   PHP ,   HTML (Rails) , \n                 HTML (Jinja Templates) ,   HTML (Twig) ,   HTML+CFML , \n                 ColdFusion ,   ColdFusionCFC ,   laravel-blade , \n                 Handlebars ,   AngularJS , \n                 SomeNewLanguage   //  --- New language \n             ] \n         } \n     ],   Let s say you want to insert a new rule between two rules. You can turn on debug mode and call the  BracketHighlighter: (Debug) Filter Rules by Key  then select position to see the current rule order and their position index.  To turn on Debug mode, just add  debug_enable : true  to your user settings file.  Example of  BracketHighlighter: (Debug) Filter Rules by Key  output:  [ \n     [ \n         { name :   curly ,   position :   0 }, \n         { name :   round ,   position :   1 }, \n         { name :   square ,   position :   2 }, \n         { name :   html ,   position :   3 }, \n         { name :   cfml ,   position :   4 }, \n         { name :   php_angle ,   position :   5 }, \n         { name :   angle ,   position :   6 }, \n         { name :   cssedit_groups ,   position :   7 }, \n         { name :   ruby_embedded_html ,   position :   8 }, \n         { name :   ruby ,   position :   9 }, \n         { name :   c_compile_switch ,   position :   10 }, \n         { name :   php_keywords ,   position :   11 }, \n         { name :   erlang ,   position :   12 }, \n         { name :   bash ,   position :   13 }, \n         { name :   fish ,   position :   14 }, \n         { name :   mylang ,   position :   15 } \n     ], \n     [ \n         { name :   py_single_quote ,   position :   0 }, \n         { name :   py_double_quote ,   position :   1 }, \n         { name :   single_quote ,   position :   2 }, \n         { name :   double_quote ,   position :   3 }, \n         { name :   jsregex ,   position :   4 }, \n         { name :   perlregex ,   position :   5 }, \n         { name :   rubyregex ,   position :   6 }, \n         { name :   mditalic ,   position :   7 }, \n         { name :   mdbold ,   position :   8 } \n     ]  ]   Then you can specify the position you want to insert at using the  position  key:       user_scope_brackets :   [], \n     user_brackets :   [ \n         { \n             name :   mylang , \n             position :   4 ,   //  -- New position \n             open :   ^\\\\s*\\\\b(if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro|do)\\\\b , \n             close :   \\\\b(e(?:if|subr|bytemap|enum|command|for|while|macro)|until)\\\\b , \n             style :   default , \n             scope_exclude :   [ string ,   comment ], \n             plugin_library :   User.bh_modules.mylangkeywords , \n             language_filter :   whitelist , \n             language_list :   [ mylang ], \n             enabled :   true \n         } \n     ],   And if you run the debug command again, you will see that the position has changed:           { name :   curly ,   position :   0 }, \n         { name :   round ,   position :   1 }, \n         { name :   square ,   position :   2 }, \n         { name :   html ,   position :   3 }, \n         { name :   trex ,   position :   4 },   //  -- New position \n         { name :   cfml ,   position :   5 }, \n         { name :   php_angle ,   position :   6 },   This can be used to adjust the position of default rules from your user settings as seen in the overrides above.  So, unless you are forking  BH  to pull request a change to the default rules, you can now modify the rules in just these two settings without copying or touching the default rules. This will allow you to make changes, but still receive new updated rules.       user_scope_brackets :   [], \n     user_brackets :   [],",

The color scheme I use is from my  Aprosopo theme .   Note  If a scope is not defined, it won t change the color. For instance, below I assign the hash rule for C/C++ preprocessors conditionals to  brackethighlighter.c_define , but I don t have  brackethighlighter.c_define  in my theme  dict . So it will look like the default color for this theme, white.   My personal conf: bh_core.sublime-settings  // Define region highlight styles  bracket_styles :   { \n     //  default  and  unmatched  styles are special \n     // styles. If they are not defined here, \n     // they will be generated internally with \n     // internal defaults. \n\n     //  default  style defines attributes that \n     // will be used for any style that does not \n     // explicitly define that attribute.  So if \n     // a style does not define a color, it will \n     // use the color from the  default  style. \n     default :   { \n         icon :   dot , \n         // BH1 s original default color for reference \n         //  color :  entity.name.class , \n         color :   brackethighlighter.default , \n         style :   underline \n     }, \n\n     // This particular style is used to highlight \n     // unmatched bracket pairs.

            "text": "There are two kinds of plugins that can be written  definition  plugins (plugins attached to bracket definitions via the  plugin_library  option) or  run instance  plugins (plugins that are that are fed directly into the BracketHighligher command via the command parameter  plugin ).  Bracket plugins use  BracketRegions .   class BracketRegion(begin_pt, end_pt)   BracketRegions  are simple objects containing a begin pt and end pt of a bracket.  Parameters :     Parameter  Description      begin_pt  Starting point.    end_pt  Ending point.     Attributes :     Attribute  Description      begin  The start pt of the BracketRegion.    end  The end pt of the BracketRegion.     Methods :   def size(self)  Returns size of region  def move(self, begin_pt, end_pt)   Returns a new BracketRegion object with the points moved to the specified position.  Parmenters :     Parameter  Description      begin_pt  Starting point.    end_pt  End Point.     Returns :     Return  Description      BracketRegion  BracketRegion with new starting and ending points      def to_region(self)   Converts BracketRegion to a SublimeRegion  Returns :     Return  Description      SublimeRegion  A Sublime Region.         Definition  Plugins  These are plugins that are attached to the bracket definition and aid in processing the brackets.  These kinds of plugins have three methods you can provide:  post_match ,  compare , and/or  validate .  validate   def validate(name, bracket, bracket_size, bfr)   validate  is run before comparing the bracket to its corresponding opening or closing partner.  This is used to perform additional validation on a found bracket.  For example, lets say you have a bracket that is case sensitive.   BH  uses a case insensitive search, so with validate, you can ensure the originally found bracket matches the desired case.  Parameters :     Parameter  Description      name  The name of the bracket definition being evaluated.    bracket  The bracket region being validated.    bracket_side  Opening (0) or closing (1) bracket.    bfr  The file buffer.     Returns :     Return  Description      Boolean  indicates whether the validation succeeded (True) or failed (False).     Example: Should match closing tag  end  but not match  End  case   Foo   of \n     Guard1   -   ok ; \n     Guard2   -   End  end   Example (from erlangcase.py):  def   validate ( name ,   bracket ,   bracket_side ,   bfr ): \n     text   =   bfr [ bracket . begin : bracket . end ] \n     return   text . lower ()   ==   text     compare   def compare(name, first, second, bfr)   compare  is run when comparing the opening bracket with closing brackets.  This allows you to provide logic to accept or reject the pairing of an opening bracket with a closing bracket.  You should not change the text in the view during this operation.  Paramters :     Parameter  Description      name  The name of the bracket definition being evaluated.    first  A bracket region for the opening bracket.    second  A bracket region for the closing bracket.    bfr  The file buffer.     Returns :     Return  Description      Boolean  Indicating whether the the comparison yields a suitable match.     Example (from phphekywords.py):  def   compare ( name ,   first ,   second ,   bfr ): \n     return   end   +   bfr [ first . begin : first . end ] . lower ()   ==   bfr [ second . begin : second . end ] . lower ()      post_match   def post_match(name, style, first, second, center, bfr, threshold)   post_match  is run after the brackets have been matched.  You can do things like alter the highlighting region and change the bracket_style if needed. You should not change the text in the view during this operation.  Parameters :     Parameter  Description      name  The name of the bracket definition being evaluated.    style  The style definition name that is to be used to highlight the region.    first  A bracket region for the opening bracket.    second  A bracket region for the closing bracket.    center  Position (pt) of cursor (in retrospect, probably not the most intuitive name; not sure why I named it this).    bfr  The file buffer.    threshold  The calculated search window of the buffer that is being searched.     Returns :     Return  Description      BracketRegion  Opening bracket region.    BracketRegion  Closing bracket region.    style  The name of the style definition to use.     Example (from rubykeywords.py):  import   re  def   post_match ( view ,   name ,   style ,   first ,   second ,   center ,   bfr ,   threshold ): \n     if   first   is   not   None : \n         # Strip whitespace from the beginning of first bracket \n         open_bracket   =   bfr [ first . begin : first . end ] \n         if   open_bracket   !=   do : \n             m   =   re . match ( r ^(\\s*\\b)[\\w\\W]* ,   open_bracket ) \n             if   m : \n                 first   =   first . move ( first . begin   +   m . end ( 1 ),   first . end ) \n     return   first ,   second ,   style    Example (snippet from tags.py)  def   post_match ( view ,   name ,   style ,   first ,   second ,   center ,   bfr ,   threshold ): \n     left ,   right   =   first ,   second \n     threshold   =   [ 0 ,   len ( bfr )]   if   threshold   is   None   else   threshold \n     tag_settings   =   sublime . load_settings ( bh_core.sublime-settings ) \n     tag_mode   =   get_tag_mode ( view ,   tag_settings . get ( tag_mode ,   {})) \n     tag_style   =   tag_settings . get ( tag_style ,   angle ) \n     bracket_style   =   style \n\n     if   first   is   not   None   and   tag_mode   is   not   None : \n         matcher   =   TagMatch ( view ,   bfr ,   threshold ,   first ,   second ,   center ,   tag_mode ) \n         left ,   right   =   matcher . match () \n         if   not   matcher . no_tag : \n             bracket_style   =   tag_style \n\n     return   left ,   right ,   bracket_style      highlighting   def highlighting(view, name, style, right)   highlighting  is the last hook that gets run.  This is at a point when  BH  no longer cares about what the  actual  bracket region is, so it is safe to modify it for highlighting purposes.  The view really shouldn t be modified here.  Parameters :     Parameter  Description      view  The current view containing brackets.    name  The name of the bracket definition being evaluated.    style  The style definition name that is to be used to highlight the region.    left  A bracket region for the opening bracket (could be  None .    right  A bracket region for the closing bracket (could be  None .     Returns :     Return  Description      BracketRegion  Opening bracket region.    BracketRegion  Closing bracket region.     Example (snippet from tags.py)  def   highlighting ( view ,   name ,   style ,   left ,   right ): \n          Highlight only the tag name.       \n     if   style   ==   tag : \n         tag_name   =   [\\w\\:\\.\\-]+ \n         if   left   is   not   None : \n             region   =   view . find ( tag_name ,   left . begin ) \n             left   =   left . move ( region . begin (),   region . end ()) \n         if   right   is   not   None : \n             region   =   view . find ( tag_name ,   right . begin ) \n             right   =   right . move ( region . begin (),   region . end ()) \n     return   left ,   right     Run Instance  Plugins  Run instance  plugins are manually invoked bracket matching with an attached plugin. \nThe plugin itself is executed after a match is made.  When defining a manually invoked  BH  command, either  bh_key  or  bh_async_key  should be used (key referring to key binding, but is also used for the menu and command palette).  It may be misleading as to what  bh_async_key  means, but it is mainly a workaround to launch  BH  keys from the command palette.  The command is kicked off asynchronously to ensure the palette closes before executing, but the  BH  command itself is still synchronous.  Example of run instance plugin getting called:  // Go to left bracket \n     { \n         caption :   BracketHighlighter: Jump to Left Bracket , \n         command :   bh_key , \n         args : \n         { \n             lines   :   true , \n             plugin : \n             { \n                 type :   [ __all__ ], \n                 command :   bh_modules.bracketselect , \n                 args :   { select :   left } \n             } \n         } \n     },    The  args  parameter is a dictionary.     Parameter  Description      lines  Show the number of lines between the matched brackets in the status bar.    no_outside_adj  This is a parameter used to tell the plugin to ignore the  bracket_outside_adjacent setting.  This is by default used for the  bracketselect commands to ignore outside adjacent matching so it can do expanding selections or jump to parents brackets.  The default is  false when not defined, but it can be set to  true or  null in JSON (it would be  None if defined directly in Python code).  When  null  the value will be read from  ignore_outside_adjacent_in_plugin setting in the  bh_core.sublime-settings file for convenient altering of the behavior.    plugin  Configuration for the plugin to be used.     The  plugin  parameter is a dictionary that contains 3 arguments that define which plugin should get run, under which circumstance it is run, and with what parameters it is run with.     Parameter  Description      type  An array containing the bracket definition names that the plugin should be run on.  Use  __all__ for all bracket definitions.    command  The plugin to run.  For internal plugins, they are referenced by  bh_modules. plugin name   For custom plugins, you should use the folder path relative to  Packages   So if I had a plugin called  myplugin.py in my  User folder, I would use  User.myplugin    args  A dictionary containing the arguments to feed into the plugin.     You create  run instance  plugins by deriving a class from the  BracketPluginCommand  class.  Then you provide a method called  plugin  that returns the class.   class BracketPluginCommand()   Attributes :     Attribute  Description      view  The sublime view containing the bracket (don t change this).    left  A bracket region for the opening bracket (can be changed).    right  A bracket region for the closing bracket (can be changed).    selection  An array containing the selection that triggered the match (can be changed).    refresh_match  A plugin can set this to true if the plugin has moved the cursor in such a way that the current highlighted match is no longer valid.  This will cause  BH  to setup another match when idle. An example of this is in the  bracketselect bh_plugin; the cursor can be moved outside the matching brackets requiring a refresh to match the parent when the command is complete.    nobracket  This was added mainly for sub-bracket matching (a bracket inside other brackets like round brackets in quotes/strings).  This is set to true if the plugin has caused both left and right brackets to be returned as  None and it is not desired to fall back and match the parent.     Methods :   def run(edit, name,  args )   Parameters :     Parameter  Description      edit  The sublime edit object.    name  The bracket definition being evaluated.       Example (from foldbracket.py):  import   BracketHighlighter.bh_plugin   as   bh_plugin  import   sublime  class   FoldBrackets ( bh_plugin . BracketPluginCommand ): \n     def   run ( self ,   edit ,   name ): \n         content   =   sublime . Region ( self . left . end ,   self . right . begin ) \n         new_content   =   [ content ] \n         if   content . size ()     0 : \n             if   self . view . fold ( content )   ==   False : \n                 new_content   =   self . view . unfold ( content ) \n         self . selection   =   new_content  def   plugin (): \n     return   FoldBrackets",

            "text": "BH uses Python s re regex engine, but it also adds some additional back references to aid in the creation of bracket patterns.  This is done with a custom wrapper called backrefs that was originally written for  RegReplace .  Backrefs was written to add various additional backrefs that are known to some regex engines, but not to Python s re.  Backrefs adds:  \\p ,  \\P ,  \\u ,  \\U ,  \\l ,  \\L ,  \\Q  or  \\E  (though  \\u  and  \\U  are replaced with  \\c  and  \\C ).  Search Back References     Back References  Description      \\c  Uppercase character class.  ASCII or Unicode when re Unicode flag is used.  Can be used in character classes  []    \\l  Lowercase character class.  ASCII or Unicode when re Unicode flag is used.

Can be used in character classes  []    \\L  Inverse lowercase character class.  ASCII or Unicode when re Unicode flag is used.  Can be used in character classes  []    \\Q...\\E  Quotes (escapes) text for regex.   \\E signifies the end of the quoting. Will be ignored in character classes  []    \\p{UnicodeProperty}  Unicode property character class. Search string must be a Unicode string. Can be used in character classes  []  See  Unicode Properties  for more info.     \\P{UnicodeProperty}  Inverse Unicode property character class. Search string must be a Unicode string. Can be used in character classes  []  See  Unicode Properties  for more info.      Replace Back References  None of the replace back references can be used in character classes  [] .  Since bracket rules are only for search, replace back references will only apply if using the backrefs module in a bh_plugin.     Back References  Description      \\c  Uppercase the next character.    \\l  Lowercase the next character.    \\C...\\E  Apply uppercase to all characters until either the end of the string or the end marker  \\E is found.    \\L...\\E  Apply lowercase to all characters until either the end of the string or the end marker  \\E is found.      Tip  Complex configurations of casing should work fine.   \\L\\cTEST\\E     Test  \\c\\LTEST\\E     Test  \\L\\cTEST \\cTEST\\E     Test Test    Unicode Properties  Unicode properties can be used with the format:  \\p{UnicodeProperty} .  The inverse can also be used to specify everything not in a Unicode property:  \\P{UnicodeProperty} .  They are only used in the search patterns. You can use either the verbose format or the terse format, but only one property may specified between the curly braces.  If you want to use multiple properties, you can place them in a character class:  [\\p{UnicodeProperty}\\p{OtherUnicodeProperty}] .
